Welcome to xcache!

If you haven't already, create an X.509 certificate/key for the service,
register it in the experiment's VO services, and create a secret named "certs" with 
hostcert.pem and hostkey.pem referring to the certificate and key.

Clients may need set the environment variable
  XrdSecGSISRVNAMES={fqdn of the service} if accessing internally.
